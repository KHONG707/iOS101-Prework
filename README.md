  - Real-time collaboration with comments and mentions
  - Database views (table, board, calendar, gallery)
 
- Spotify
  - Personalized playlists (Discover Weekly, Daily Mixes)
  - Cross-device playback sync (start on phone, continue on desktop)
  - Collaborative playlists (share and edit with friends)
 
- Instagram
  - Easy photo/video filters and editing tools
  - Stories & Reels for bite-sized, ephemeral content
  - Direct messaging with customizable themes

App Idea:
“Study Buddy” app that allows for real-time peer collaboration. The core idea is to let students create or import notes, have the app automatically turn key concepts into spaced-repetition flashcards, and then schedule personalized review sessions. On top of that, a potential “Live Study Room” feature could be built where you can jump into small group video chats, share screens, and run quick quizzes against friends. A progress dashboard could be included that tracks time spent, accuracy trends, and suggests when to revisit topics based on your performance curve. This way you get both the benefits of adaptive review and the motivation of social learning.
